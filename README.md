# Jiggly_Mouser
This wiggles and jiggles your mouse to make it look like you're still there :D


## How to use it
You enter how many seconds you want between mouse movements (please dont set it to 0. That will make you loose controll of your mouse)
Then you enter how long it should wait before it starts
