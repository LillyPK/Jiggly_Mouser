# Jiggly_Mouser
This program moves your mouse around to make it look like you're still there :D


## How to use it
You enter how many seconds you want between mouse movements.
Then you enter how long it should wait before it starts.
After that, just minimize the program and it will run pasivly.
It will detect if you're moving your mouse and when you're typing so when you're active, the program waits.

# Installation
Currently, there is no dedicated installer.

> go to the [releases](https://github.com/LillyPK/Jiggly_Mouser/releases) page and download the latest version. and put the exe somewhere safe thats also easy to access.
